# HeyAgent CLI

HeyAgent CLI is a bidirectional Telegram bridge for Claude Code and Codex.
Send and receive Telegram messages with Codex or Claude (and switch any time).

Fully free, fully open source, and fully local — no server or external storage required.

### v2 Update

Note: before v2, this project focused on notification integration for CLI coding agents.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g heyagent
```

## Usage

```bash
# Resume latest session (default)
hey claude
hey codex

# Create new session
hey claude --new
hey codex --new

# Run with explicit session id
hey claude --session [SESSION-ID]   # resumes given session
hey codex --session [SESSION-ID]    # resumes given session

# Show local pairing/session status
hey status

# Reset Telegram setup (clears bot token + chat pairing)
hey reset

# Non-interactive reset
hey reset --yes
```

## Setup and Pairing Flow

Start with `hey claude` or `hey codex`.

On first run, HeyAgent will:

1. Ask for setup mode:
   - **Phone setup** (recommended) — scan one QR code and complete guided steps on your phone
   - **Manual fallback** — no tunnel required; paste the bot token directly into the terminal
2. In phone setup mode, CLI starts a temporary local server exposed via a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel and shows a single QR code. (This same tool is handy for reaching your local dev environment from your phone.)
3. Complete guided steps on phone:
   - Open BotFather
   - Create your own bot
   - Submit bot token
   - Open bot chat and press START
4. CLI validates token, waits for pairing, and stores bot + chat locally.

Manual fallback avoids tunneling completely:

1. Create your own bot
2. Paste bot token into the terminal.
3. CLI shows bot opening link/QR for pairing.

If recommended phone onboarding fails in your environment, install system `cloudflared`
(for example `brew install cloudflared`) or choose manual fallback.

## Telegram Commands

Inside Telegram:

- `/help` list commands
- `/new` force next prompt to run as a new session
- `/claude` switch active provider to Claude
- `/codex` switch active provider to Codex
- `/status` show provider, directory, bot, session, and pairing
- `/stop` stop current execution and clear queued messages

Any other text message is forwarded to the active agent.
For voice input, keyboard dictation on your phone is recommended.

## Local CLI Input

When running in an interactive terminal, HeyAgent also accepts live local input.

- Plain text: run prompt through provider and send response to Telegram
- `/ask <prompt>` same as plain text
- `/say <text>` send raw message directly to Telegram
- `/new` force next prompt to start a fresh session
- `/stop` stop current execution and clear queued Telegram messages
- `/claude` switch to Claude provider
- `/codex` switch to Codex provider
- `/status` print local bridge status
- `/help` show local commands
- `/exit` stop the running bridge

CLI logs are shown for inbound Telegram commands, local prompts, and outgoing messages.

## Provider Execution

Default runtime:

- `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p --output-format json "<prompt>"`
- `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json "<prompt>"`

You can override default bypass behavior by passing explicit provider permission flags, for example:

- `hey claude --permission-mode acceptEdits`
- `hey codex --full-auto`

Session startup strategy:

- `--new` force first prompt to start fresh session
- `--session <session-id>` : resumes the session given by its id
- default (no startup flag): same as `--resume` / `--continue`, resume latest in current provider/project

## Notes

- Fully local-served
- Sleep prevention is always enabled while bridge is running.
- Lid-close sleep is not reliably controllable by app-level code:
  - macOS: use clamshell mode setup (external power/display/input) for closed-lid operation.
  - Windows/Linux: requires OS power settings or admin-level policy changes.
- Polling-only runtime (no webhooks).
- One chat per running CLI process.
- If you send new messages while a request is in progress, HeyAgent queues and groups those messages into the next run.
- Telegram attachments are forwarded to the active provider (documents, images, audio, voice notes, and videos).
- Config is stored at `~/.heyagent/config.json`
